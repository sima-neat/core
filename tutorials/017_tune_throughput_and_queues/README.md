## Concept

Tune three knobs that control async pipeline behavior under load — queue depth, overflow policy, metrics — and read back what happened. Performance tuning only helps once the correctness baseline is stable; this chapter assumes it is.

The chapter exercises `RunOptions` at the level a production pipeline needs to control:
- `queue_depth`: how many in-flight samples the runtime accepts.
- `overflow_policy`: `Block`, `KeepLatest`, or `DropIncoming` when the queue is full.
- `enable_metrics`: turn on per-run metric collection.

**APIs introduced**
- `pyneat.RunOptions()` with `.queue_depth`, `.overflow_policy`, `.output_memory`, `.enable_metrics`.
- `pyneat.OverflowPolicy.{Block,KeepLatest,DropIncoming}` — the policy values.
- `run.try_push(sample)` — non-blocking push that returns whether the sample was accepted.
- `run.stats()` — latency/enqueue/pull counters.
- `run.input_stats()` — push-side counters (accepted, dropped, queue fullness).

**When to use this**
- Throughput bottlenecks: increase queue depth and inspect drop/latency behavior.
- Low-latency preference: favor `KeepLatest` in bursty streams.
- Backpressure-sensitive ingestion: prefer `Block` for strict loss control.

**Prerequisites**
Chapter 002 (async basics). Chapter 011 (diagnostics).

## Learning Process
1. Build an async run path with explicit queue and overflow settings.
2. Push a deterministic workload and drain outputs to completion.
3. Inspect metrics and input stats for latency/drop behavior.
4. Validate tuning run completion with `CHECK`, `SIGNATURE`, and `[OK]`.

## What To Observe
- `CHECK ...` lines should indicate contract and runtime validation outcomes.
- `SIGNATURE ...` output should summarize machine-parseable chapter behavior.
- `[OK] ...` indicates the chapter flow completed successfully.

## Run

**Python:**
```bash
python3 share/sima-neat/tutorials/017_tune_throughput_and_queues/tune_throughput_and_queues.py \
  --iters 32 --queue 4 --drop block
```

**C++:**
```bash
./lib/sima-neat/tutorials/tutorial_v2_017_tune_throughput_and_queues \
  --iters 32 --queue 4 --drop block
```
